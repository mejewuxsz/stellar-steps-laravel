# Build After Changes

After making any code changes to this project, run the production build so compiled assets are up to date:

```bash
cd c:\Users\quija\OneDrive\Desktop\stellar-steps-laravel; npm run build
```

- Run this **after** editing frontend/JS/React (e.g. `resources/js/`, `resources/css/`), config, or any change that affects the Vite bundle.
- Use PowerShell-compatible command separators (`;` not `&&`) when chaining commands.
- If the change is purely backend (e.g. PHP only, no JS/CSS), you may skip the build only when the user has not asked to build.

When in doubt, run `npm run build` after changes.
